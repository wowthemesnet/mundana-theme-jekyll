    # The sizes attribute is both important, and impossible to offer good defaults for. You need to
    # learn about it. Short version: Web browsers parse web pages line-by-line. When they run into
    # an external asset they must download, they start that process immediately, without waiting to
    # finish rendering the page. This means that at the point in time when the browser must decide
    # which image to download, it has no clue how large that image will be on the page. The sizes
    # attribute is how we tell it.
    #
    # If you do not provide this, the web browser will assume the image is 100vw (100% the width of
    # the viewport.)
    #
    # This doesn't have to be pixel-perfect, just close enough for the browser to make a good
    # choice. Keys are media queries defined above, values are how large the image will be when
    # that media query is true. You can't use % (percentage width of the parent container) for the
    # same reason we have to do this at all.
    sizes:
      mobile: calc(100vw - 16px)
      tablet: 80vw

    # Size is unconditional; provided either after all conditional sizes (above) or alone. If you
    # only have a 'size' (no 'sizes'), and it's a constant (px, em, or rem), you should use a
    # pixel-ratio srcset.
    size: 800px

  # You can use this as jpt-webp. All following presets follow the same pattern.

  # generate, but you get good file sizes even compared to webp of similar quality.
  avif:

  # Your build times will suffer, but everyone is happy.
