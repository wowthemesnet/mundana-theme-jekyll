This deceptively delicious salad is the perfect addition to a summer meal. Lightly adapted from [Smitten Kitchen](https://smittenkitchen.com/2015/04/obsessively-good-avocado-cucumber-salad/) to be vegan, it’s just as obsessive and craveable as advertised. I used to slightly dread the cucumber overload from our summer CSA (how many green salads can we eat before I never want to see lettuce again?), but no more – this is one I’ll happily eat all summer.

### Ingredients

- 2 medium cucumbers, chopped into ~1/2-inch cubes
- 3 scallions, thinly sliced OR 1/4 cup white onion, small diced
- 1 large avocado, diced
- 1/4 cup raw cashews, soaked for 4+ hours
- 1 tbsp. lime juice
- 1 tsp. Sriracha or other hot sauce
- 1/4 tsp. salt
- 1/4 cup flat leaf parsley, chopped

### Directions

1. Prepare the dressing: in a high-speed blender, combine the raw cashews with 2 tbsp. of water, the lime juice, Sriracha, and salt. Blend until smooth, adding more water to reach your desired consistency.
2. Combine all ingredients and fold together. Adjust salt and seasonings as needed.
