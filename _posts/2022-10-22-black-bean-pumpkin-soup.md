This black bean soup is a simple weeknight option that is flavorful, filling, and super clean; we've adapted this from [Smitten Kitchen's original](https://smittenkitchen.com/2007/11/black-bean-pumkin-soup/) to be vegan. If you're not a pumpkin soup fan, give this one a try anyway - despite the pumpkin, the flavors aren't your typical cinnamon and pie spices. We enjoy this all soup-season long, serving it alongside sourdough bread and a simple salad!

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 1 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
- 1 yellow onion, chopped
- 2 shallots, minced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 1/2 tbsp. ground cumin
- 1/4 tsp. smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp. black pepper
- 3/4 tsp. salt
- 4 1/2 cups cooked black beans
- 4 cups vegetable stock
- 1 cup crushed tomatoes from a can
- 16 oz pureed pumpkin
- 2 tbsp. plus 1 tsp. apple cider vinegar, divided

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. In a large soup pot over medium heat, heat the olive oil and saute the onion and shallot for about 7 minutes or until softened. Stir in the garlic, spices, and salt and cook for another minute until fragrant.
2. Add the black beans, stock, tomatoes, pumpkin puree, and 2 tbsp. of apple cider vinegar. Stir to combine.
3. Bring the soup to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. Let cook for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened.
4. Using an immersion blender, roughly puree the soup until the consistency is creamy but not entirely smooth. (You can also do this step in an upright blender by carefully transferring the soup and blending it.)
5. Stir in the last 1 tsp. of apple cider vinegar before serving.
