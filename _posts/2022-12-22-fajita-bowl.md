When we visited Los Angeles last year, we ate at the wonderful [Gracias Madre](https://graciasmadre.com/) and enjoyed some of the best vegan food I've ever tasted. Naturally when they published a [cookbook](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/609430/the-gracias-madre-cookbook-by-gracias-madre/) it was a no-brainer to add this to our bookshelf! The fajitas that inspired this lunch bowl are deceptively delicious for the low effort involved, and pair wonderfully with an oil-free cashew queso plus a few other simple components like beans and rice.

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

**For the black beans***

- 1 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
- 1/2 onion, chopped
- 1 jalapeno, seeded and chopped
- 1.5 cups dried black beans, soaked for 8+ hours
- 1 bay leaf
- 1/2 tsp. dried oregano
- 1 tsp. salt

**For the mushroom fajitas**

- 16 oz. cremini mushrooms, quartered
- 4 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 3/4 tsp. salt
- 4 yellow onions, thinly sliced
- 2 tsp. dried oregano
- 1 bay leaf
- 3 poblano peppers, seeded and thinly sliced
- 1 red bell pepper, seeded and thinly sliced
- 2 tsp. apple cider vinegar

**For the cashew queso**

- 1 cup raw cashews, soaked for 4+ hours
- 2 tbsp. pumpkin seeds, soaked with cashews for 4+ hours
- 1/2 of a jalapeno, seeded and chopped
- 2 tbsp. lemon juice
- 1 clove garlic
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1/2 tsp. smoked paprika
- 1 tsp. chili powder
- 3/4 cup water

**To assemble**

- Cooked brown rice
- Shredded romaine lettuce
- Avocado, sliced or cubed
- Refried beans, such as from a can

<h3> Directions </h3>

**Make the black beans***

1. In an Instant Pot, heat the insert on Saute mode and add olive oil. When shimmering, add the onion and jalapeno and cook for about 7 minutes until softened. Add the remaining ingredients to the IP insert along with several cups of water, enough to cover the beans by at least an inch.
2. Set the IP to pressure cook mode and place the lid in sealed/locked position. Cook the beans for 25 minutes followed by a 10 minute slow release.
3. Drain the beans and discard the bay leaf. Set aside.

4. Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F and line a baking sheet with a Silpat or parchment paper. Toss the mushrooms with 1 tbsp. olive oil, the minced garlic, and 1/4 tsp. salt and transfer to the baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes until the mushrooms are lightly golden and have released some, but not all, of their liquid.
5. In a large pan over medium-high heat, heat the remaining 3 tbsp. olive oil. Add the onions, bell pepper, oregano, bay leaf, and 1/2 tsp. of salt and cook for about 15 minutes, stirring regularly, until the onions are softened and starting to brown. Add the poblanos and apple cider vinegar and cook for another 10 minutes until everything is soft and caramelized.

**Make the cashew queso**
6. Drain the cashews and pumpkin seeds, then combine all ingredients in a high-speed blender and blend until smooth. 

**Assemble bowl**
7. Place 3/4 cup brown rice in a bowl and top with 1/2 cup of black beans, 1/2 cup of peppers and onions, 1/4 cup of mushrooms, avocado, refried beans, lettuce, and a few tablespoons of cashew queso. Serve with your favorite salsa as well, if desired.



**Notes**
- You could use canned or plain black beans in this bowl to save some time, but the extra effort is worth it for more flavorful beans as written here.
- If not using an Instant Pot, you can make the beans as written on the stovetop, cooking for about an hour.
