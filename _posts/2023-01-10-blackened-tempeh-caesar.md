This is one of our favorite lunches to meal prep and enjoy all week. The blackened tempeh is flavorful and nutritionally awesome, the coconut bacon is sweet and salty, and the (oil-free!) cashew caesar dressing ties everything together.

Based on a recipe from [Cafe Gratitude's cookbook](https://cafegratitude.com/products/love-is-served-cookbook), this also makes a great wrap.

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

**For the tempeh and marinade**

- 3 8-oz. blocks of tempeh
- 1/2 an onion, chopped
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 tbsp. ginger, chopped
- 1 jalapeno, seeded
- 2 tsp. sugar
- 2 tsp. dried thyme
- 2 tsp. black pepper
- 1/2 tsp. allspice
- 1/8 tsp. nutmeg
- 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper
- 2 tbsp. lime juice
- 2 tbsp. soy sauce
- 2 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
- 1 cup water

**For the blackening spice blend (makes extra)**
- 2 tbsp. paprika
- 1.5 tsp. salt
- 1.5 tsp. cayenne pepper
- 3/4 tsp. smoked paprika
- 3/4 tsp. chili powder
- 1.5 tsp. dried thyme
- 1.5 tsp. dried oregano
- 1.5 tsp. black pepper

**For the coconut bacon**
- 2 cups dried unsweetened coconut chips
- 1 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
- 1/2 tsp. smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp. chili powder
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1/3 cup maple syrup

**For the cashew caesar dressing**
- 1/2 cup raw cashews, soaked for at least 4 hours
- 2 tbsp. pumpkin seeds, soaked for at least 4 hours
- 3 tbsp. lemon juice
- 1 garlic clove
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1/4 tsp. black pepper
- 1/3 cup water

**To assemble**
- 2 cups shredded romaine lettuce
- 1/2 cup diced tomato
- 1/2 avocado, cubed
- 2 tsp. capers

<h3> Directions </h3>

**Make the blackened tempeh**

1. Combine all ingredients for the marinade, excluding the tempeh, in a high-speed blender and blend until smooth. Using a fork, poke holes in the blocks of tempeh. Place the tempeh in a wide, shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours.
2. Mix together all ingredients for the blackening spice blend in a bowl. When the tempeh is done marinating, lightly oil a large skillet and place over medium-high heat. Remove the tempeh from the marinade and sprinkle the blackening seasoning on one side of the tempeh. Place spice-side down in the skillet and sprinkle blackening seasoning on the face-up side of the tempeh. Let cook for 5-7 minutes per side until the spices are blackened.
3. Remove tempeh from the pan along with any blackened seasoning that didn't stick, and cut into 1/2 inch cubes. Set aside.

**Make the coconut bacon**
4. While tempeh is marinating, preheat the oven to 250&deg;F and line a baking sheet with a Silpat or parchment paper. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Combine the coconut chips, olive oil, and spices in the skillet and toast for 5-6 minutes, stirring continuously. When the coconut is a golden brown, stir in the maple syrup and cook for another minute or two.
5. Transfer the mixture to the baking sheet and spread out. Toast in the oven for 10-15 minutes, stirring once halfway through, until the coconut chips are dry. Remove and allow to cool completely before breaking apart with your hands and storing in an airtight container.

**Make the cashew caesar dressing**
6. Drain the cashews and pumpkin seeds, then combine all ingredients in a high-speed blender and blend until smooth. Taste for seasoning and add water to thin the dressing if necessary.

**Assemble salad**
7. Divide lettuce, tomato, avocado, and capers between two bowls. Top each with 1/2 cup of tempeh cubes, 1/4 cup of coconut bacon, and toss with 1/4 cup of cashew caesar dressing.
