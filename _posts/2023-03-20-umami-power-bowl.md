A simple and satisfying lunch that is very meal-preppable, this bowl leans on a rich umami sauce adapted from [Andrew Weil](https://www.drweil.com/diet-nutrition/recipes/umami-sauce/). A variety of beans or pulses can be used with great results, and we encourage you to experiment with different roasted veggies too!

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 1 1/2 cups dried black lentils
- 1/2 cup onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 3/4 tsp. dried thyme
- 2 medium sweet potatoes, sliced about 1/4-inch thick and then cut into quarter moons
- 2 large broccoli crowns, cut into florets
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt and pepper

**For the umami sauce**
- 2 tbsp. apple cider vinegar
- 1/2 cup nutritional yeast
- 3 tbsp. soy sauce or tamari
- 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 1/4 cup water
- 3 cloves garlic

**To assemble**
- 2 cups shredded lacinato kale, lightly massaged
- 1 cup cooked brown rice
- 1/4 cup roasted pumpkin seeds

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. **Roast the veggies** Preheat the oven to 400&deg;F. Toss the prepared sweet potatoes in a tbsp. or so of olive oil and spread in a single layer on two sheet pans. Repeat with the broccoli florets. Roast for 20-30 minutes until your desired level of roastiness. Toss in salt and pepper to taste.
2. **Make the lentils** While veggies are roasting, in a medium saucepan, heat a splash of olive oil over medium heat and add the onions. Cook for about 5 minutes until the onions become translucent, then add the garlic, thyme, black lentils, 1 tsp. of salt, and 3 cups of water. Bring to a simmer and cook for about 15 minutes, until the lentils are tender but still holding their shape. Drain excess water and set the lentils aside.
3. **Make the umami sauce** Combine all ingredients and blend together, either in a high-speed blender or using an immersion blender.

**Assemble bowls**
4. Divide kale and rice between two bowls. Top each with 3/4 cup of lentils, 1/2 cup each of roasted sweet potatoes and broccoli, 2 tbsp. of pumpkin seeds, and top with a few spoonfuls of umami sauce.
