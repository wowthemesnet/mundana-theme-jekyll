This is one of the easiest meals I've made in a while and has a ton of flavor despite the minimal effort. I love the combination of black beans and sweet potatoes, which are balanced out here by the canned green chiles. I served this with some wilted spinach, cashew queso, and corn tortillas, but I think it would be equally good over rice or another grain.

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 1 1/2 cups dried black beans, soaked for 8+ hours and then drained and rinsed
- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 4-oz. cans of diced green chiles
- 3/4 tsp. dried cumin
- 3/4 tsp. chili powder
- 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 2 medium sweet potatoes, sliced about 1/4-inch thick and then cut into quarter moons
- 4 cups of spinach
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt and pepper

**To serve**
- 2 tbsp. [cashew queso]({% post_url 2022-12-22-fajita-bowl %})
- 2 corn tortillas, warmed
- 1/4 cup roasted pumpkin seeds

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. **Make the black beans** Heat a tbsp. of olive oil in the insert of an Instant Pot on saute mode. Once hot, add the onions and cook for 4-5 minutes or until softened and translucent. Add the garlic, green chiles, spices and salt and cook for another minute. Add the black beans and about 2 cups of water, which should just cover the beans. Set the Instant Pot to pressure cook mode for 30 minutes, and when done allow to slow release for 10 minutes.
2. **Roast the sweet potatoes** Preheat the oven to 400&deg;F. Toss the prepared sweet potatoes in a tbsp. or so of olive oil and spread in a single layer on two sheet pans. Roast for 20-30 minutes until your desired level of roastiness. Toss in salt and pepper to taste.
2. **Wilt the spinach** While everything else is cooking, in a medium saucepan, heat a splash of olive oil over medium heat and add the spinach. Cover and let cook for about 3 minutes until the spinach is wilted. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.

**To serve**
4. Place a few generous scoops of black beans in a bowl and top with sweet potatoes and spinach. Top with a dollop of cashew queso, a few tablespoons of pumpkin seeds, and serve alongside warm corn tortillas.
