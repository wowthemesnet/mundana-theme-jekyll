Now that it's finally starting to feel like spring here, I've been craving lighter meals that can be served cold or at room temperature. This bowl featuring curried chickpeas and broccoli leans on the tahini-based dressing which is spiced, a tiny bit sweet, and bright. It's perfect for meal prepping, or you could simply serve the curried salad on its own as a side dish!

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

**For the curried chickpeas and broccoli**
- 3 cups cooked chickpeas
- 1 head broccoli, finely chopped
- 4 scallions, thinly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 cup tahini
- Juice from 1/2 of a lemon
- 1.5 tsp. maple syrup
- 2 tsp. curry powder
- 1 tsp. ground turmeric
- 1 tsp. salt
- Black pepper
- ~8 tbsp. warm water

**For the quick pickled onions**
- 1 red onion, thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1 tbsp. sugar
- 1.5 tsp. salt
- 1 cup water

**To assemble**
- 3 cups shredded lacinato kale, lightly massaged
- 1 cup cooked quinoa or other grain
- 1/4 cup roasted almonds, chopped
- 2 tbsp. dried cranberries

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. **Make the quick pickled onions** In a medium bowl, whisk together the apple cider vinegar, sugar, salt, and water until the sugar and salt have dissolved. Place the onions in a jar and pour the vinegar mixture over. Let sit at room temperature while you prepare the other ingredients.
2. **Make the curried chickpeas and broccoli** Place the chickpeas, broccoli, and scallions in a large bowl. Whisk together the remaining ingredients in a separate bowl, thinning with water as needed and adjusting the dressing to taste. Pour the dressing over the chickpeas and broccoli and mix.

**Assemble bowls**
3. Divide kale and quinoa between two bowls. Top each with about a cup of curried chickpeas, a generous forkful of onions, and the almonds and cranberries.
