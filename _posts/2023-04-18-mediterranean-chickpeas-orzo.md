<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Cook the orzo in boiling water according to package instructions, typically 7-10 minutes. When orzo is done, drain and toss in a large bowl with the minced garlic, chopped parsley, a tablespoon of olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.
2. While the orzo is cooking, toss the diced tomatoes and cucumbers with lemon juice, a tablespoon of olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste.
3. Combine all ingredients for the greek cashew dressing in a high speed blender and blend until smooth. Adjust salt and nutritional yeast to taste.

**Assemble bowls**
4. Divide kale and chickpeas between two bowls. Top each with about a half cup each of tomato cucumber salad and orzo, a generous forkful of pickled onions, and toss with a tablespoon or two of dressing.
