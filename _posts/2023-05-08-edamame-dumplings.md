These Asian-inspired dumplings are a fun and easy mash-up, using store bought Chinese dumpling wrappers and pre-shelled edamame (soybeans). You can use whatever type of dumpling wrapper you prefer - I find the round Shanghai style easy to work with. I'll typically make a batch and freeze most of the dumplings; they're quick to defrost it's nice to have an easy appetizer or snack on hand! I like them pan fried best, but you could easily steam these as well.

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

**For the dumplings**
- 16 oz. package of shelled edamame soybeans, defrosted if frozen
- 1 clove garlic
- 1/2 tsp. chili flakes
- 1.5 tbsp. soy sauce
- 1.5 tsp. toasted sesame oil
- 2 tsp. rice vinegar
- 2.5 tbsp. water
- About 32 store bought vegan dumpling wrappers, defrosted if frozen
- Avocado oil, for pan frying

**For the chili crisp dipping sauce**
- 2 tbsp. soy sauce
- 1 tsp. rice vinegar
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1/2 tsp. chili crisp
- 1/2 tsp. toasted sesame oil

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Cook the edamame as instructed on the package, if applicable. Combine all ingredients for the dumplings except for the wrappers and avocado oil in a food processor and puree, scraping down the sides as needed, until you have a fairly thick mixture. It may still be a bit grainy; this is fine.
2. Fill the dumplings: Lay out a dozen or so wrappers on a cutting board or clean surface and fill a small bowl with water. Place about a tablespoon of the edamame puree on each wrapper. To seal the dumplings, dip your index and middle finger in the water and run them along the outer edge of the dumpling wrapper to moisten it. Fold the dumpling into a half-moon and press together the edges to seal. Slightly bend the edges of the dumpling to create a crescent shape, if you like. **Note:** I am definitely a dumpling-folding novice but this simple method gets the job done. For more detailed instructions or advanced techniques, I recommend checking out Youtube!
3. Repeat, filling dumplings until you've used all the edamame puree. At this point, you may freeze any dumplings you won't be eating today. Spread them out on a baking sheet and let freeze before storing in a container or freezer bag.
4. Prepare the dipping sauce by whisking together all ingredients.
5. To pan fry dumplings, begin with fresh or defrosted dumplings. Heat a small amount of avocado oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the dumplings, flattening them against the pan, and push them around a bit to ensure they don't stick. Fry for 1-2 minutes until the bottoms are golden brown, then add about 1/4 cup of water to the pan and immediately cover the pan with a vented lid. Watch out for oil spattering here as well. Let the dumplings continue to cook for about 5 minutes or until the water is almost completely evaporated. Remove from heat and serve with the dipping sauce.
