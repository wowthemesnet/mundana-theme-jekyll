This recipe was inspired by combining a few components from other favorite meals including [these seasoned black beans]({% post_url 2022-12-22-fajita-bowl %}) and one of my first ever posts, [this breakfast tofu scramble]({% post_url 2021-04-22-breakfast-tofu-scramble %}). This is a hearty breakfast for fueling up before a big day of hiking, or a simple meal prep option if you (like us) enjoy breaking labels and eating breakfast foods for other meals. It's 2023 and I think we can all agree that breakfast foods belong at all meals, right?

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

**For the seasoned black beans**

- 1 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
- 1/2 onion, chopped
- 1 jalapeno, seeded and chopped
- 1 cup dried black beans, soaked for 8+ hours and drained
- 1 bay leaf
- 1/2 tsp. dried oregano
- 1 tsp. salt

**For the crispy potatoes**
- 3-4 medium-sized potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 1 tsp. dried rosemary
- 1/2 tsp. salt, plus more to taste
- Extra virgin olive oil

**For the tofu scramble**
- 1 12-oz. block of firm or extra firm tofu
- 1/2 tsp. turmeric
- 1/2 tsp. garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp. onion powder
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1 tbsp. nutritional yeast
- 1 tbsp. tahini paste
- 2 tbsp. soy, almond, or other non-dairy milk
- Avocado oil

**To assemble**
- Burrito-sized flour tortillas
- Avocado, sliced
- Salsa of your choosing

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Preheat your oven to 450&deg;F.

**Make the black beans**

1. In an Instant Pot, heat the insert on Saute mode and add olive oil. When shimmering, add the onion and jalapeno and cook for about 7 minutes until softened. Add the remaining ingredients to the IP insert along with several cups of water, enough to cover the beans by at least an inch.
2. Set the IP to pressure cook mode and place the lid in sealed/locked position. Cook the beans for 25 minutes followed by a 10 minute slow release.
3. Drain the beans and discard the bay leaf. Set aside.

**Roast the potatoes**

1. Toss the cubed potatoes in some olive oil and spread them out over silicone- or parchment-lined baking sheets. Place the sheets in the preheated oven and roast for 20-25 minutes, until the potatoes are crispy. Remove from the oven and toss with salt and dried rosemary.

**Make the tofu scramble**

1. While the beans and potatoes are cooking, drain and press the tofu.
2. In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the spices, salt, nutritional yeast, tahini, and non-dairy milk to form a paste. Using your hands, break and crumble the tofu into the prepared spice paste. Mix well, ensuring the tofu is evenly coated.
3. Heat a tbsp. or so of avocado oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Once hot, add the tofu and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring regularly, until the tofu is browning.

**Assemble burritos**
1. In each tortilla, place generous spoonfuls of beans, tofu, and potatoes. Layer on sliced avocado and salsa before folding the ends of the tortilla inward and rolling until you have a nicely packaged burrito. Warm in a frying pan over low heat for a few minutes to seal the burrito. Serve with more salsa on the side.
