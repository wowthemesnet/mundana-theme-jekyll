Chocolate chip cookies have always been my favorite dessert, and one of my favorite foods in general. I'll go far out of my way for a good vegan chocolate chip cookie, but since I started baking these I don't have to anymore! Adapted from [Cafe Gratitude's](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/598239/love-is-served-by-cafe-gratitude-with-seizan-dreux-ellis/) original recipe, these cookies are chonky, bakery-sized, made of whole-food ingredients, and loaded with chocolate chips and walnuts. If you have company, make a double batch because despite their size, these will go fast!

<h3> Ingredients </h3>

- 3/8 cup of almond flour
- 3/8 cup of gluten-free or all purpose flour
- 1/2 cup rolled oats
- 1/2 cup walnuts, chopped
- 3/4 cup vegan chocolate chips (See Note)
- 1/4 to 1/2 cup granulated sugar (See Note)
- 3/4 tsp. ground cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1 tsp. baking powder
- 1/4 tsp. baking soda
- 1/3 cup coconut milk
- 1/3 cup maple syrup
- 1 tbsp. chia seeds
- 1/4 cup coconut oil, melted and cooled
- 1/2 cup almond butter

<h3> Directions </h3>

1. Preheat your oven to 325&deg;F and line two baking sheets with silicone mats or parchment paper.
2. Combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl and mix well: flours, oats, walnuts, chocolate chips, sugar, cinnamon, salt, baking powder, and baking soda.
3. In a blender, combine the coconut milk, maple syrup, and chia seeds and blend for about one minute. Add this mixture to the dry ingredients, then add the melted coconut oil and almond butter. Stir well until you have a soft dough.
4. Form cookies onto the prepared baking sheets: use about 1/4 cup of dough per cookie (I know, it feels like a lot. Trust me on this), flattening the cookies a bit and spacing them out by a few inches. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the edges are beginning to brown; the cookies should still be a little soft at this point. Remove the baking sheets and let the cookies firm up for another 5 minutes before transferring to cooling racks to cool completely.

**Notes**
- The chocolate chips are such an important component to this recipe that I recommend splurging for a high-quality option - we like Guittard.
- I've written before on this blog about how I prefer desserts to be less sweetened. I use 1/4 cup of sugar in this recipe, which I find perfect, but if you have more of a sweet tooth you may want to go up to the 1/2 cup.
- You *could* make these cookies smaller and bake them for less time - cookies that are half this size might take around 8 minutes to bake - but I'll encourage you one last time to make them as written. You'll thank me after you eat one and realize it's the perfect sized treat.
