    "body": "2019/10/23 - Motivation: Before now, me as a undergraduate student, I was parsimony who usually depend on colab, kaggle, friend’s server(occasional) whenever i need GPU. .   And this time it’s been for a while to install GPU than I expected and I share the several component that stood in my way.   Written at Oct 24 2019, if you think this is deprecated, please do not have a leap of faith.         1. Did not know there is JupyterLab in Google Cloud Platform. : At the first time when GCP came out, there was no AI Platform service. So from starting vm instance to launching jupyter and installing packages, I did all of the things myself. (but I learned 🤗) $	curl -O https://repo. continuum. io/archive/Anaconda3-5. 0. 1-Linux-x86_64. sh[Downloading conda in ssh]  I created VM instance,selected zone, machine type and disk type. Then, define firewall rules and in ssh terminal, install jupyter and other packages. But you can do all of these things AI Platform.  [AI Platform] I think if you are at Asia-Pacific, it can save your time.       2. Consider if the platform has limited resources in a region you live in. :  I live in South Korea, East Asia, and it seems like this region has lots of limitation in GPU (except quite expensive AWS).  And the Taiwan which was the only one region where I can launch my own VM with GPU (I tried all the other regions in the list) sometimes do normaly, but not always. 😥  After launching, I did several works and next day I could not start VM. (I didn’t count it, but tried it a few hours because I didn’t want cost any more time…)  Endlessly failed to start instance, then I choose to move AWS as an alternative way.       3. Fast. ai gives deliberate guide and I didn’t know it. :  Fast. ai offer the guide for all available platform. (Colab, salamander, Gradient, Kaggle, Colab, and so on)  It is so important, and really needs, because cloud computing options are vary as occasion and purpose arise.  I didn’t know fast. ai has manual to running GCP, and I think it’s as good a reason as any for me to be have taken time.  It helped me so much when I had aws and shortened time.       4. You should wait to add more volume just after add volume, by building AWS EC2. :  Since Elastic Block Store(EBS) storage supports optimized storage, users can’t extend storage volume two times in a row.  Unfortunately, at the first time, I didn’t know it (again 👻) and when VM lacked volume, I doubled dist capacity (76*2) at a rough but It needs more.   "

(maybe assumed stochastic, 5 data points in validation)     it takes about 11. 36 hours to update parameters even single layer and 1 iteration!

Let’s try!   Elementwise ops: How can we make python faster?:  If we want to calculate faster, then do remove pythonic calcuation, by passing its computation down to something that is written something other than python, like pytorch.  According to PyTorch doc it uses C++ (via ATen), so we are going to implement that function with python.  What is element wise operation?:  items makes a pair, operate corresponding component Frobenius norm:       $ | A |F = \left( \sum{i,j=1}^n   a_{ij}   ^2 \right)^{1/2} $    above converted into(m\*m). sum(). sqrt()&gt;    Plus, don’t suffer from mathmatical symbols.
