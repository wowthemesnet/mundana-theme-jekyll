# INF 141 Syllabus Brooke 

Hello everyone,

Welcome (back) to UCI and to Information Retreival!  My name is Brooke (she/her/hers)--I am a second-year student in the Computer Science master's program, and I'm so excited to get to know you all throughout the quarter!  Before we begin, I ask that you read this mini-syllabus of mine (as well as the general course syllabus): 



## Course Assistance

In accordance with the general course format, both discussion sections and office hours will be occuring in a hybrid in-person/ Zoom format.  

### Discussion

I will be holding two discussion sections per week: **Wednesday 3:00pm in [SE2 1304](https://classrooms.uci.edu/classrooms/se2/se2-1304/)**, and **Wednesday 4:00pm via Zoom**.

Attendance is not mandatory but is highly encouraged.  

Discussion will be hosted in an open-question format, I will attempt to clarify any questions or concepts about homework or upcoming Quizzes.  On discussions held the week of quizzes, I will (prepare??? TODO ask Crista and how nice can we be about quiz prep) questions related to that upcoming quiz.  Other sections will be 

I will attempt to record the sessions (please remind me at the beginning!), and will upload the recording to Canvas after it finshes processing. 

#### Safety

Per [university policy](https://uci.edu/coronavirus/), it is mandatory to wear your masks in the classroom, regardless of vaccination status.  Generally, I would not have a preference if you interchange which section time you attend.  However to comply with university COVID-19 safety, the in-person section cannot fill beyond the room capacity of **75**. Seats will be given to students registered in that section.  

### Office Hours

I will be holding 2 hours of office hours per week, 1-2pm Mondays and Wednesdays, via Zoom.  This time is ideal for specific questions regarding your homework.  I'll answer questions first come, first serve, and will be open to anyone who joins who wishes to listen in.  No appointment necessary, just hop on in!  



### Extra Credit

**Ed Discussion:**

- Posts will not be answered during weekends and holidays by the teaching team.
- To motivate other students to answer the questions and to try to improve the student-student interaction, the teaching team will wait before answering the posts, thus giving a chance to students to fulfill the required number of answers to receive the participation bonus points (but you must post as yourself, as if you post as anonymous we will not count the answer).
- Need to answer about 1-3 posts per week to qualify, keep this in mind! 



## Further Resources

### Contact

For this course, communication will exclusively take place on [EdDiscussion](https://edstem.org/us/courses/13796/discussion/).  

I encourage you to post course-related content to classmates as Public in order to receive Discussion Participation points.  If you have a matter that needs to be addressed between yourself and the teaching team, please create a Private thread.  



### Diversity and Inclusion

Computer Science unfortunately suffers from lack of representation--from women and folks of color in particular.  We all are responsible for helping to create a welcoming, inclusive atmosphere.  I ask that you work with me and your fellow students by being respectful and encouraging, to allow us to create an environment that fosters intellectual growth.  



### Student Health and Wellbeing

For many of us, this is our first quarter back in-person on campus.  If you feel overwhelmed about the transition back, I encourage you to seek help--[UCI Wellness, Health and Counseling Services](https://whcs.uci.edu/) has many great free resources for us students! 

Additionally, students with a diagnosed disability that requires accommodation, please contact the [Disability Services Center](https://dsc.uci.edu/) and the teaching team as soon as possible.  



Thank you everyone, I'm looking forward to meeting you all and having a great, successful quarter! 

Brooke
